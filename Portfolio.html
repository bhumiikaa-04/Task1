            <h3>
                
                <li style="font-size: larger;">Hey there! I'm Bhumika Patidar, currently pursuing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Applications (BCA) as a second-year student. I'm passionate about exploring the vast world of technology and its applications in solving real-world problems.</li>
                <li style="font-size: larger;">As a student of BCA, I've been diving deep into subjects like programming, database management, web development, and more. I'm fascinated by the endless possibilities that technology offers and constantly seek to expand my knowledge and skills.</li>
                   
                <li style="font-size: larger;">While my academic focus lies in the realm of computer applications, I'm also keen on developing a wide range of skills. From coding in languages like Java, Python, and HTML/CSS to exploring concepts in data structures and algorithms, I'm always eager to learn something new.</li>
                    
                <li style="font-size: larger;">Though still early in my academic journey, I've already had the opportunity to work on a few projects that have allowed me to apply my knowledge in practical settings. From creating simple web applications to solving programming challenges, each experience has been a stepping stone in my growth as a budding technologist.</li>
                   
                <li style="font-size: larger;">Looking ahead, I'm excited about the possibilities that lie ahead in my journey. I aspire to delve deeper into specialized areas within the field of computer science, such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, or software engineering. My goal is to leverage my skills and passion to make a meaningful impact in the tech industry.</li>
                    
                <li style="font-size: larger;">When I'm not buried in textbooks or coding away on my laptop, you can find me doing art and craft & sketching. Whether it's exploring the latest tech trends, participating in coding competitions, or simply enjoying a good book, I believe in maintaining a well-rounded lifestyle.</li>
